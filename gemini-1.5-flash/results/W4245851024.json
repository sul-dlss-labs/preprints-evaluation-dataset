"abstract": "Animal advocacy campaigns are increasingly popular, but their effectiveness is rarely assessed. We conducted a meta-analysis of 100 studies to assess the effectiveness of animal advocacy interventions for reducing meat consumption. We found that interventions were effective, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.16 (95% CI: 1.08â€“1.25). Interventions targeting individual-level determinants of behaviour were more effective than those targeting social-level determinants. Interventions that were longer in duration were more effective than those that were shorter in duration. Our findings suggest that animal advocacy interventions are effective for reducing meat consumption, and that interventions targeting individual-level determinants of behaviour are more effective than those targeting social-level determinants.",

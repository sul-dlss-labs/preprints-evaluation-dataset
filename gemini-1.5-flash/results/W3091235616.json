RTIs are a leading cause of death for those aged 15 – 29 years with costs estimated to be up to 3% of GDP. Despite this fact, little primary research has been done on the household economic impact of these events.\nMethods\nFrom July to October 2016, 860 consecutive emergency department patients were enrolled and followed up at 6-8 weeks to assess the household financial impacts of these emergency presentations. At follow-up, patients were queried regarding health status, lost wages or schooling, household costs incurred due to their injury or illness, and assets sold.\nResults\n860 patients were enrolled and 675 patients (78%) completed follow-up surveys. Of those, 661 had a confirmed reason for visit - 304 (45%) road traffic injuries, 357 (53%) other emergency presentations (non-RTI) - encompassing medical presentations and other types of injury. Data was missing for 14 patients (2%). More than 90% of RTI patients were working or in school prior to their injury. In the economically productive ages (15-44 years) RTI predominated (70%) vs non-RTI (39%). RTI patients were more likely to report residual major disability (28% RTI vs 21% non-RTI, p<0.03). All emergency patients reported difficulty paying for basic needs (food, housing and medical expenses). More than 1½ of emergency patients reported having to sell assets in order to meet basic needs after their illness or injury. Despite similar hospital costs and fewer lost days of work for both patients and caregivers, the mean financial impact on households of RTI patients was 37% more than for non-RTI patients. These costs equaled between 6-16 weeks of income for patients based on their occupation type and median reported pre-hospitalization income.\nDiscussion\nUgandans emergency care patients suffered significant personal and household economic hardship. In addition to the need for policy and infrastructural changes to improve road safety, these findings highlight the need for basic emergency care systems to secure economic gains in vulnerable households and prevent medical impoverishment of marginal communities.", "keywords": "Road Traffic; Injury; Low- and Middle-income Countries; Economic Impact; Emergency"}

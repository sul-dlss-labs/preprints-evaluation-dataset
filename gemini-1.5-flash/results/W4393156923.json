One approach is to use cohorts of members of prestigious academies, where birth and death dates are recorded for their members. This approach was widely popularized when in 2023 a highly-read New York Times articleÂ³ noticed that deaths of Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) members peaked during December 2022 and January 2023. Linked to explosive spread of COVID-19 in Mainland China after removal of restrictive measures, deaths of academicians were believed to reflect the magnitude of excess death toll across Mainland China. This concept adopted in a meticulous epidemiological study concluded from CAE death data that the urban-dwelling population of Mainland China had 917,000 excess deaths during these two months. The current analysis dissects the validity of this approach using data from different academies and from Nobel laureates.", "keywords": ["excess deaths", "academies", "elderly", "bias", "COVID-19", "life tables", "selective reporting"]}

This study compared serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers for the A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 and B strains after trivalent allV3 and trivalent HD-IIV3 in an older adult population.\nResults\nThe immunogenicity population included 342 participants who received allV3 and 338 participants who received HD-IIV3. The proportion of participants that seroconverted to A(H3N2) vaccine strains after allV3 (112 participants [32.8%]) was inferior to the proportion of participants that seroconverted after HD-IIV3 (130 participants [38.5%]) at day 29 after vaccination (difference, −5.8%; 95%CI, −12.9% to 1.4%). There were no significant differences between the vaccine groups in percent seroconversion to A(H1N1)pdm09 or B vaccine strains, in percent seropositivity for any of the strains, or in post-vaccination GMT for the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain. The GMTs for the post-vaccination A(H3N2) and B strains were higher after HD-IIV than after allV3.\nConclusions\nOverall immune responses were similar after allV3 and HD-IIV3. For the primary outcome, the allV3 seroconversion rate for H3N2 did not meet noninferiority criteria compared with HD-IIV3, but the HD-IIV3 seroconversion rate was not statistically superior to the allV3 seroconversion rate."}

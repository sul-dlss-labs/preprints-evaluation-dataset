In a cohort of 216 drugs approved by the German drug regulatory authority between 2011 and 2016, the independent Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) judged that 22 (10%) new drugs had substantial benefits compared to already available treatments, while 125 (58 %) drugs had no proof of added benefits. Cohort studies of oncology drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that most drugs were approved without evidence of benefits on overall mortality or quality of life. Similarly, an analysis of oncology drugs approved by the EMA between 2014 and 2016 reported that many pivotal trials underpinning drug approvals were of high risk of bias due to problems with the trial design and or trial conduct. It has been argued that the threshold for new drug approvals has been lowered to accommodate the pharmaceutical industry's interests, and researchers have advocated for more pragmatic, patient-relevant trials.", "keywords": ["clinical trial design", "drug approval", "FDA", "EMA", "psychiatry", "methodology", "systematic review", "guidelines", "conflicts of interest", "stakeholders"]}

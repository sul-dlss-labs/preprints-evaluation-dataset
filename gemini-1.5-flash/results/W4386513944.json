This guidelines article provides a comprehensive overview of quantitative perfusion imaging of the brain using multi-timepoint arterial spin labeling (ASL), along with recommendations for its acquisition and quantification. Acquiring ASL data with multiple label durations and/or post-labeling delays (PLDs) enables efficient mapping of perfusion, offering comparable accuracy to a conventional single-PLD approach within the same scan time. Additionally, multi-timepoint ASL allows for the estimation of arterial transit time (ATT) and the generation of ATT maps, mitigating the impact of variable and prolonged ATTs on perfusion measurements and providing valuable clinical insights. However, the acquisition and postprocessing of multi-timepoint ASL data presents challenges beyond single-PLD ASL, impeding its widespread adoption. Building upon the 2015 ASL consensus article, this work highlights the protocol distinctions specific to multi-timepoint ASL and provides robust recommendations for acquiring high-quality data. Additionally, we propose an extended quantification model based on the 2015 consensus model and discuss relevant postprocessing options to enhance the analysis of multi-timepoint ASL data. Furthermore, we review the potential clinical applications where multi-timepoint ASL is expected to offer significant benefits. This article is part of a series published by the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) Perfusion Study Group, aiming to guide and inspire the advancement and utilization of ASL beyond the scope of the 2015 consensus article.", "keywords": ["arterial spin labeling", "perfusion", "cerebral blood flow", "arterial transit time"]}

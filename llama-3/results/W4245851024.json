Most attention to reducing consumption has focused on restructuring environments where foods are chosen or on making health or environmental appeals. However, psychological theory suggests that interventions appealing to animal welfare concerns might operate on distinct, potent pathways. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the e\ufb00ec-tiveness of these interventions. We searched eight academic databases and extensively searched grey literature. We meta-analyzed 100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals, that measured behavioral or self-reported outcomes related to meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions, and that had a control condition. The interventions consistently reduced meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions at least in the short term with meaningfully large e\ufb00ects (meta-analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95% CI: [1.13, 1.33]). We estimated that a large majority of true population e\ufb00ects (71%; 95% CI: [59%, 80%]) were stronger than RR = 1.1 and that few were in the unintended direction. Via meta-regression, we identi\ufb01ed some speci\ufb01c characteristics of studies and interventions that were associated with e\ufb00ect size. Risk-of-bias assessments identi\ufb01ed both methodological strengths and limitations of this literature; however, results did not di\ufb00er meaningfully in sensitivity analyses retaining only studies at the lowest risk of bias. Evidence of publication bias was not apparent. In conclusion, animal welfare inter-ventions preliminarily appear e\ufb00ective in these typically short-term studies of primarily self-reported outcomes. Future research should use direct behavioral outcomes that mini-mize the potential for social desirability bias and are measured over long-term follow-up.", "keywords": ["meta-analysis", "nutrition", "behavior interventions", "meat consumption", "planetary health"]}

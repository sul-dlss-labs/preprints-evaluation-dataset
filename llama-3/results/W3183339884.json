Here, copies of a good arrive and perish according to Poisson point processes. Buyers arrive similarly and make take-it-or-leave-it o\ufb00ers for unsold items. The objective is to maximize the (in\ufb01nite) time average revenue of the seller. Our main results are pricing-based policies which (i) achieve a 1/2-approximation of the op- timal o\ufb04ine policy, which is best possible, and (ii) achieve a better than (1\u22121/e)-approximation of the optimal online policy. Result (i) improves upon bounds implied by recent work of Collina et al. (WINE\u201920), and is the \ufb01rst optimal prophet inequality for a stationary problem. Result (ii) improves upon a 1 \u22121/e bound implied by recent work of Aouad and Sarita\u00b8c (EC\u201920), and shows that this prevalent bound in online algorithms is not optimal for this problem.", "keywords": []}

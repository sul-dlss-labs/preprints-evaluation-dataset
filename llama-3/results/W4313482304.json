Because the Tremaines bought artists\u2019 work very close to an artwork\u2019s creation, with 69% of works in our study purchased within one year of the year when they were made, their collecting practice can best be framed as venture-capital investment in art. The Tremaines also illustrate art collecting as social-impact investment, owing to their combined strategy of art sales and museum donations for which the collectors received a tax credit under US rules. Because the Tremaines\u2019 museum donations took place at a time that U.S. marginal tax rates from 70% to 91%, the near \u201cdonation parity\u201d with markets, creating a parallel to ESG investment in the management of multiple forms of value.", "keywords": ["Art investment", "venture capital", "social impact", "portfolio management", "tax arbitrage"]}

{"title": "Job-Finding and Job-Losing: A Comprehensive Model of Heterogeneous Individual Labor-Market Dynamics", "authors": [{"first": "Robert E.", "last": "Hall"}, {"first": "Marianna", "last": "Kudlyak"}], "abstract": "We study the paths over time that individuals follow in the labor market, as revealed in the monthly Current Population Survey. Some people face much higher \ufb02ow values from work than in a non-market activity; if they lose a job, they \ufb01nd another soon. Others have close to equal \ufb02ow values and tend to circle through jobs, search, and non-market activities. And yet others have \ufb02ow values for non-market activities that are higher than those in the market, and do not work. We develop a model that identi\ufb01es and quanti\ufb01es heterogeneity in dynamic individual behavior. Our model provides a bridge between research on monthly transition rates in the tradition of Blanchard and Diamond (1990) and research on economic dynamics in the tradition of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Our estimates discern 5 distinct types. Most unemployment comes from just two of those types. Low employment types frequently circle among unemployment, short-term jobs, and being out of the labor market. Short-term jobs play a role in the job-\ufb01nding process related to the role of unemployment. These are stop-gap jobs for high-employment types and a part of circling for low-employment types. Because of their high job-\ufb01nding rates, and despite their low \ufb02ow values of non-work relative to work, the volatility of the future lifetime value that high-employment types derive from work and non-work is lower than for low-employment types.", "keywords": ["JEL E24", "J63", "J64"]}

For precise examination of tooth structure damage in the area of EMCs (i.e. whether it crosses the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) and reaches dentin or pulp), volumetric (three-dimensional (3D)) evaluation of EMCs is necessary. The aim of this study was to present an X-ray micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) as a technique suitable for 3D non-destructive visualization and qualitative analysis of different severity teeth EMCs.", "keywords": ["tooth fractures", "dental literature", "X-ray micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT)", "EMC position"]}

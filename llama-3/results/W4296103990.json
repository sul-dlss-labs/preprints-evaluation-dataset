{"title": "Selecting For Extremists: Evaluating the Impact of Judicial Selection Methods on Ideology", "authors": [{"first": "Brett", "last": "Parker"}], "abstract": "U.S. states display striking heterogeneity in their choices of judicial selection method.\nResearchers have produced dozens of papers exploring how the most commonly-used\nselection methods\u2014partisan election, nonpartisan election, merit selection, and uncon-\nstrained gubernatorial appointment\u2014a\ufb00ect the ideology and behavior of the judges\nthey produce. Nevertheless, these articles have studied only a limited set of outcome\nvariables. Most published work concerns either how selection method a\ufb00ects (1) judicial\nresponsiveness to public opinion or (2) ideological direction. To my knowledge, however,\nno empirical work explores how choice of selection method impacts ideological extremity.\nThis paper \ufb01lls that gap. Using generalized propensity score matching, \ufb01xed e\ufb00ects\ncounterfactual estimators, and synthetic controls to conduct causal inference, I examine\nwhether some methods of selection produce more moderate (or extreme) judges than\nothers. In order to do so, I extend and supplement the Bonica-Woodru\ufb00dataset on state\nsupreme court judges, which features a commonly used measure of judicial ideology\nextracted from political donations. I \ufb01nd consistent evidence that judges picked by\nunconstrained gubernatorial appointment are more extreme on average than those\nselected by other methods. However, I do not \ufb01nd substantial evidence of di\ufb00erences\nbetween other pairs of selection methods.", "keywords": ["Judicial Selection", "State Politics", "Ideological Extremity"]}

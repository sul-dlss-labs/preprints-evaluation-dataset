In this paper, we present Grouptron, a multi-scale dynamic forecasting framework that leverages pedestrian group detection and utilizes individual-level, group-level and scene-level information for better understanding and representation of the scenes. Our approach employs spatio-temporal clustering algorithms to identify pedestrian groups, creates spatio-temporal graphs at the individual, group, and scene levels. It then uses graph neural networks to encode dynamics at different scales and aggregate the embeddings for trajectory prediction. We conducted extensive comparisons and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 9.3% decrease in final displacement error (FDE) compared with state-of-the-art methods on ETH/UCY benchmark datasets, and 16.1% decrease in FDE in more crowded scenes where extensive human group interactions are more frequently present.\",  \"keywords\": []}"}]}]}

Methods: Sanger sequencing was performed on samples obtained from a longitudinal HIV surveillance programme (study A, 2013-2014) and the HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System (study B, 2014-2015). Sequences were included for adult HIV positive participants (age \u226515 years for study A, age 15-49 years for study B) with no documented prior exposure to ART. Overall and drug class-specific PDR was estimated using the World Health Organization 2009 surveillance drug resistance mutation (SDRM) list and phylogenetic analysis was performed to establish evidence of drug resistance transmission linkage. Results: One thousand eight hundred and forty-five (1845) sequences were analysed (611 study A; 1234 study B). An overall PDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.0-11.7) was observed for study A and 11.0% (95% CI 8.9-13.2) for study B. In study B, the prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) PDR exceeded 10% for sequences collected in 2014 (10.2%, 95% CI 7.5-12.9). The most prevalent SDRMs were K103NS (7.5%), M184VI (2.4%) and V106AM (1.4%). There was no evidence of large transmission chains of drug-resistant virus.

In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-1170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLUex. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLUex away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLUex results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low (~1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLUex rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population (~1%), is only accessible when GLUex is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLUex protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.\",  \"keywords\": []}"}]}]}

Due to the preferential incorporation of \u2077Li into clay minerals during chemical weathering, the isotope ratio \u03b4\u2077Li may be used to interrogate the balance of primary mineral dissolution and clay precipitation. This balance has been linked to relative rates of chemical and physical denudation, such that dissolved \u03b4\u2077Li (\u03b4\u2077Lidiss) is highest at moderate weathering intensities when chemical and physical denudation are comparable. However, we argue that current theory linking \u03b4\u2077Li to weathering regimes through fluid travel times are unable to explain observations of low \u03b4\u2077Li and high Li concentrations in rapidly eroding settings. In this study, we re-examine the relationships between \u03b4\u2077Li, Li concentration, and weathering regime by incorporating Li isotopes into simulations of weathering profiles using a reactive transport model (CrunchFlow) that includes advective fluxes of regolith to simulate variable erosion rates in response to uplift. In these simulations, fractionation is implemented through a kinetic fractionation factor during clay precipitation, which allows the \u03b4\u2077Li of dissolved and suspended loads in the model to vary as a function of Li/Al ratios in primary and secondary minerals. When the model is run over a range of infiltration and erosion rates, simulations reproduce observed global patterns of \u03b4\u2077Lidiss and suspended load \u03b4\u2077Li as a function of weathering intensity, controlled primarily by water travel times and mineral residence times in weathered bedrock. We find that reduced water travel times at low weathering intensity, however, are inconsistent with observations of high Li concentrations. As an alternative, we demonstrate how the rapid weathering of soluble, Li-rich minerals such as chlorite under low weathering intensities may resolve this apparent discrepancy between data and theory. We also suggest that observed patterns are consistent with geothermal Li sources under low weathering intensities. This work offers a foundation guiding future studies in testing potential mechanisms underlying global riverine \u03b4\u2077Lidiss.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"Lithium isotopes\",    \"weathering regime\",    \"reactive transport model\",    \"chemical weathering\",    \"critical zone isotopes\"  ]}"}]}]}

In this study, we assessed the influence of Schistosoma mansoni infection on host responses in a Ugandan fishing cohort given a Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine. Concentrations of schistosome-specific circulating anodic antigen (CAA) pre-vaccination showed a significant bimodal distribution associated with HepB titers, which were lower in individuals with high CAA. We established that participants with high CAA had significantly lower frequencies of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) subpopulations pre- and post- vaccination and higher regulatory T cells (Tregs) post-vaccination. Polarization towards higher frequencies of Tregs: cTfh cells can be mediated by changes in the cytokine environment favoring Treg differentiation. In fact, we observed higher levels of CCL17 and soluble IL-2R pre-vaccination (important for Treg recruitment and development), in individuals with high CAA that negatively associated with HepB titers. Additionally, alterations in pre-vaccination monocyte function correlated with HepB titers, and changes in innate-related cytokines/chemokine production were associated with increasing CAA concentration. We report, that by influencing the immune landscape, schistosomiasis has the potential to modulate immune responses to HepB vaccination. These findings highlight multiple Schistosoma-related immune associations that could explain abrogated vaccine responses in communities with endemic infections.\",  \"keywords\": []}"}]}]}

We aimed to evaluate the validity of this approach. Study design and setting: Data were analyzed from living and deceased member lists from Mainland China, UK and Greece academies; and Nobel laureates (and US subset thereof). Samples of early elected academicians were probed for unrecorded deaths; datasets overtly missing deaths were excluded from further analyses. Actuarial risks were compared against the general population in the same country in respective age strata. Relative incidence risk increases in death in active pandemic periods were compared to population-wide pandemic excess death estimates for the same country. Results: Royal Society and Academy of Athens datasets overtly missed deaths. Pre-pandemic death rates were 4-12-fold lower in the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) versus respective age strata of the Mainland China population. A +158% relative increase in death risk was seen in CAE data during the first 12-months of wide viral spread. Both increases (+34% in British Academy) and decreases (-27% in US Nobel laureates) in death rates occurred in pandemic (2020-22) versus pre-pandemic (2017-2019) years; point estimates were far from known excess deaths in the respective countries (+6% and +14%, respectively). Published excess death estimates for urban-dwelling Mainland China selectively analyzed CAE, but not another Chinese academy (Chinese Academy of Sciences) with half the pandemic death rates.

Methods: Patients with either presumed autosomal dominant LQT5 (N = 229) or the recessive Type 2 Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS2, N = 19) were enrolled from 22 genetic arrhythmia clinics and 4 registries from 9 countries. KCNE1 variants were evaluated for ECG penetrance (defined as QTc > 460ms on presenting ECG) and genotype-phenotype segregation. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compare the associations between clinical and genetic variables with a composite primary outcome of definite arrhythmic events, including appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks, aborted cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death. Results: A total of 32 distinct KCNE1 rare variants were identified in 89 probands and 140 genotype positive family members with presumed LQT5 and an additional 19 JLNS2 patients. Among presumed LQT5 patients, the mean QTc on presenting ECG was significantly longer in probands (476.9 \u00b1 38.6ms) compared to genotype positive family members (441.8 \u00b1 30.9ms, p<0.001). ECG penetrance for heterozygous genotype positive family members was 20.7% (29/140). A definite arrhythmic event was experienced in 16.9% (15/89) of heterozygous probands in comparison with 1.4% (2/140) of family members (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 11.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6-52.2; p=0.001). Event incidence did not differ significantly for JLNS2 patients relative to the overall heterozygous cohort (10.5% [2/19]; HR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.3-10.8, p=0.590). The cumulative prevalence of the 32 KCNE1 variants in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), which is a human database of exome and genome sequencing data from now over 140,000 individuals, was 238-fold greater than the anticipated prevalence of all LQT5 combined (0.238% vs. 0.001%). Conclusions: The present study suggests that putative/confirmed loss-of-function KCNE1 variants predispose to QT-prolongation, however the low ECG penetrance observed suggests they do not manifest clinically in the majority of individuals, aligning with the mild phenotype observed for JLNS2 patients.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"long QT syndrome\",    \"genetics\",    \"penetrance\",    \"arrhythmia\",    \"sudden cardiac death\"  ]}"}]}]}

Researchers have produced dozens of papers exploring how the most commonly-used selection methods-partisan election, nonpartisan election, merit selection, and unconstrained gubernatorial appointment-affect the ideology and behavior of the judges they produce. Nevertheless, these articles have studied only a limited set of outcome variables. Most published work concerns either how selection method affects (1) judicial responsiveness to public opinion or (2) ideological direction. To my knowledge, however, no empirical work explores how choice of selection method impacts ideological extremity. This paper fills that gap. Using generalized propensity score matching, fixed effects counterfactual estimators, and synthetic controls to conduct causal inference, I examine whether some methods of selection produce more moderate (or extreme) judges than others. In order to do so, I extend and supplement the Bonica-Woodruff dataset on state supreme court judges, which features a commonly used measure of judicial ideology extracted from political donations. I find consistent evidence that judges picked by unconstrained gubernatorial appointment are more extreme on average than those selected by other methods.

Second, we show that campaigns react to being placed on top of the ballot: they raise and spend more money on their campaign, and spending itself is correlated with higher vote shares.

Using graphite, transition metal dichalcogenides, layered oxides, oxyhydroxides, and olivines as examples, we explore commonalities in these materials in terms of point defects, interfacial reactions, and phase transformations.

Such evidence suggests it may be possible to quantify the mapping between self-reports of experience and 'ground-truth' or biologically related representations of those states (e.g., those inferred from measures of brain activity). Here, we used machine learning to show that self-reported descriptions of experiences across tasks can reliably map the objective landscape of task states derived from brain activity. In our study, participants provided descriptions of their psychological states while performing tasks for which the contribution of different brain systems was available from prior fMRI studies. We used machine learning to combine these reports with descriptions of brain function to form a 'state-space' that reliably predicted patterns of brain activity based solely on unseen descriptions of experience.

We tracked the reactivity of such bonds associated with the rise of the resistance to penicillin G (PenG) in protein evolution from penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to TEM \u03b2-lactamases, and with the development of avibactam (Avb) to overcome the resistance. We found that the ester linkage in PBP-PenG is resistant to hydrolysis mainly due to the small electric fields present in the protein active site. Conversely, the same linkage in the descendant TEM-PenG experiences large electric fields which stabilize the more charge-separated transition state and thus lower the free energy barrier to hydrolysis. Specifically, the electric fields were improved from - 59 to -140 MV/cm in an ancient evolution dating back billions of years, contributing 5 orders of magnitude rate acceleration. This trend continues today in the nullification of newly developed antibiotic drugs. The fast linkage hydrolysis acquired from evolution is counteracted by the upgrade of PenG to Avb whose linkage escapes from the hydrolysis by returning to a low-field environment. Using the framework of electrostatic catalysis, the electric field, an observable from vibrational spectroscopy, provides a unifying physical metric to understand protein evolution and to guide the design of covalent drugs.\",  \"keywords\": []}"}]}]}

We test two competing hypotheses: disadvantaged group members experience higher ingroup pride when using their native language due to its emotional significance (Nativity Hypothesis) or when using the language of the advantaged group due to its potential to activate subordination-dominance relations (Insecurity Hypothesis). In six experimental studies conducted among Palestinian citizens of Israel (total N = 1,348), respondents reported significantly higher ingroup pride when answering a survey in Hebrew compared to Arabic, supporting the Insecurity Hypothesis. Studies 2a-2b reported higher ingroup pride in Hebrew, regardless of the identity of the audience (ingroup vs. outgroup researcher). Study 3 replicated this result in a setting featuring the \\\"bogus-pipeline\\\" technique, suggesting that the language effect was not driven by social desirability. Finally, Study 4 examined other self-conscious constructs to validate insecurity as a potential mechanism and demonstrated that participants engaged in compensation by enhancing their collective self-esteem and attaching more positive attributes to their group in Hebrew than Arabic.

Systematically enumerating possible intermediates and reactions to the set of possible {C1, C2, and C3} CO2RR products entails 3206 intermediates and 4506 reactions. Here we use graph theory to enumerate these possibilities comprehensively, treating intermediates as graph nodes and pathways as graph edges. C3 products fall into two groups, group A (1-propanol, allyl alcohol, and propionaldehyde) and group B (acetone and hydroxyacetone); and we find that an early branch reaction, three steps after C1-C2 coupling, bifurcates these two groups of C3 products. We develop a set of C3 descriptors and screen catalysts for CO2RR to C3 products: specifically, we screen bimetallic (doped Cu) catalysts for their combination of CO binding, C\u2081-C\u2081 coupling and C1-C2 coupling. Cu and also Au- and Ag-doped Cu fulfill the first two requirements; but the set of promising C\u2081-C2 coupling catalysts (Ni-doped Pb and Al-doped Pb) needed to get to C3 is nonoverlapping with that for CO binding and C\u2081-C\u2081 coupling. Our findings agree with the experimental picture that Cu, while among the most productive to propanol, has been limited in F.E. to the 10-20% range; and that, to date, no single catalyst has achieved exceptional C3 productivity. We discuss tandem catalyst designs where a first catalyst promotes CO binding and C\u2081-C\u2081, and where these C2 and C\u2081 intermediates can come together for coupling on a second distinct class of integrated catalysts.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"electrochemical reduction\",    \"productization\",    \"propionaldehyde\",    \"acetone\",    \"hydroxyacetone\"  ]}"}]}]}

Pairing newly-collected data on the timing of reforms that democratized local offices with narrative history, I show that the institution of elected sheriff spread gradually across the country and, in many states, Americans were deeply conflicted about subjecting this important office to popular choice. One finding is that sheriffs, in most states, became elective sooner than prosecutors and judges.

We obtained data on approximately 1 million daily observations from 314 monitors in the EPA Air Quality System, 2006-2019, including daily concentrations of five routinely monitored ambient air pollutants: PM2.5, CO, NO2, O3, and VOCs. We obtained data on preproduction and production operations from Enverus and the California Geographic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) for all wells in the state. For each monitor and each day, we assessed exposure to upwind preproduction wells and total oil and gas production volume within 10 km. We used a panel regression approach in the analysis and fit adjusted fixed effects linear regression models for each pollutant, controlling for geographic, seasonal, temporal, and meteorological factors. Results. We observed higher concentrations of PM2.5 and CO at monitors within 3 km of preproduction wells, NO2 at monitors at 1-2 km, and O3 at 2-4 km from the wells. Monitors with proximity to increased production volume observed higher concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, and VOCs within 1 km and higher O3 concentrations at 1-2 km. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. Conclusion. Adjusting for geographic, meteorological, seasonal, and time-trending factors, we observed higher concentrations of ambient air pollutants at air quality monitors in proximity to preproduction wells within 4 km and producing wells within 2 km.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"oil and gas\",    \"exposure assessment\",    \"ambient air pollution\",    \"particulate matter\"  ]}"}]}]}

We explore whether generative AI could become a cost-effective complement to expert feedback by serving as an automated teacher coach. In doing so, we propose three teacher coaching tasks for generative AI: (A) scoring transcript segments based on classroom observation instruments, (B) identifying highlights and missed opportunities for good instructional strategies, and (C) providing actionable suggestions for eliciting more student reasoning. We recruit expert math teachers to evaluate the zero-shot performance of ChatGPT on each of these tasks for elementary math classroom transcripts. Our results reveal that ChatGPT generates responses that are relevant to improving instruction, but they are often not novel or insightful. For example, 82% of the model's suggestions point to places in the transcript where the teacher is already implementing that suggestion. Our work highlights the challenges of producing insightful, novel and truthful feedback for teachers while paving the way for future research to address these obstacles and improve the capacity of generative AI to coach teachers.\",  \"keywords\": []}"}]}]}

The mid-IR unresolved emission contributes more than 60% of the nuclear (diameters of 1.5\\\"~150 pc) emission in most galaxies. By contrast, the ALMA 870 \u00b5m continuum emission is mostly resolved with a median diameter of 42 pc and typically along the equatorial direction of the torus (Paper I of the series Garcia-Burillo et al. 2021). The Eddington ratios and nuclear hydrogen column densities (NH) of half the sample are favorable to launching polar and/or equatorial dusty winds, according to numerical simulations. Six of these show mid-IR extended emission approximately in the polar direction as traced by the narrow line region and perpendicular to the ALMA emission. In a few galaxies, the nuclear N\u2081 might be too high to uplift large quantities of dusty material along the polar direction. Five galaxies have low NH and/or Eddington ratios and thus polar dusty winds are not likely. We generate new radiative transfer CAT3D-WIND disk-wind models and model images at 8, 12, and 700 \u00b5m. We tailor these models to the properties of the GATOS Seyferts in this work. At low wind-to-disk cloud ratios the far-IR model images have disk- and ring-like morphologies. The characteristic \\\"X\\\"-shape associated with dusty winds is seen better in the far-IR at intermediate-high inclinations for the extended-wind configurations. In most of the explored models, the mid-IR emission comes mainly from the inner part of the disk/cone. Extended bi-conical and one-sided polar mid-IR emission is seen in extended-wind configurations and high wind-to-disk cloud ratios. When convolved to the typical angular resolution of our observations, the CAT3D-WIND model images reproduce qualitative aspects of the observed mid- and far-IR morphologies. However, low to intermediate values of the wind-to-disk ratio are required to account for the observed large fractions of unresolved mid-IR emission in our sample. This work and Paper I provide observational support for the torus+wind scenario. The wind component is more relevant at high Eddington ratios and/or AGN luminosities, and polar dust emission is predicted at nuclear column densities of up to 1024 cm-2. The torus/disk component, on the other hand, prevails at low luminosities and/or Eddington ratios.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"Galaxies: Seyfert\",    \"Submillimeter: galaxies\",    \"Infrared: galaxies\",    \"Galaxies: ISM\",    \"Galaxies: individual: NGC 1365, NGC 3227, NGC 4388, NGC 4941, NGC 5506, NGC 5643, NGC 6300, NGC 6814, NGC 7213, NGC 7314, NGC 7465, NGC 7582\"  ]}"}]}]}

The aim of this study was to present an X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT) as a technique suitable for 3D non-destructive visualization and qualitative analysis of different severity teeth EMCs. Extracted human maxillary premolars were examined using a \u00b5CT instrument ZEISS Xradia 520 Versa. In order to separate (segment) cracks from the rest of the tooth a Deep Learning Tool was utilized within the ORS Dragonfly software. The scanning technique used allowed for the recognition and detection of EMCs that are not only visible on the outer surface but also those that are deeply buried inside the tooth. The 3D visualization combined with Deep Learning segmentation enabled evaluation of EMC dynamics as it extends from the cervical to the occlusal part of the tooth, and precise examination of EMC position with respect to the DEJ.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"tooth fractures\",    \"dental literature\",    \"X-ray micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT)\",    \"EMC position\"  ]}"}]}]}

Most attention to reducing consumption has focused on restructuring environments where foods are chosen or on making health or environmental appeals. However, psychological theory suggests that interventions appealing to animal welfare concerns might operate on distinct, potent pathways. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions. We searched eight academic databases and extensively searched grey literature. We meta-analyzed 100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals, that measured behavioral or self-reported outcomes related to meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions, and that had a control condition. The interventions consistently reduced meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions at least in the short term with meaningfully large effects (meta-analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95% CI: [1.13, 1.33]). We estimated that a large majority of true population effects (71%; 95% CI: [59%, 80%]) were stronger than RR = 1.1 and that few were in the unintended direction. Via meta-regression, we identified some specific characteristics of studies and interventions that were associated with effect size. Risk-of-bias assessments identified both methodological strengths and limitations of this literature; however, results did not differ meaningfully in sensitivity analyses retaining only studies at the lowest risk of bias. Evidence of publication bias was not apparent. In conclusion, animal welfare interventions preliminarily appear effective in these typically short-term studies of primarily self-reported outcomes. Future research should use direct behavioral outcomes that minimize the potential for social desirability bias and are measured over long-term follow-up.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"meta-analysis\",    \"nutrition\",    \"behavior interventions\",    \"meat consumption\",    \"planetary health\"  ]}"}]}]}

Here, we used chronic infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to assess the influence of age on memory states at the level of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. We find that in young adults (<40 years), EBV-specific CD8+ T cells assume preferred differentiation states depending on their peptide specificity. By age >65-years, different T cell specificities had undergone largely distinct aging trajectories, which had in common a loss in adaptive and a gain in innate immunity signatures. No evidence was seen for cellular senescence or exhaustion. While na\u00efve/stem-like EBV-specific T cells disappeared with age, T cell diversity of EBV-specific memory cells did not change or even increased. In summary, by controlling for antigen specificity we uncover age-associated shifts in gene expression and TCR diversity that have implications for optimizing vaccination strategies and adoptive T cell therapy.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"Immune aging\",    \"memory T cells\",    \"EBV\",    \"T cell dysfunction\",    \"senescence\",    \"exhaustion\",    \"immune memory durability\"  ]}"}]}]}

This requires that the learned model provides an accurate representation of the input data and yields a latent space that effectively predicts outcomes relevant to the scientific question. Supervised Variational Autoencoders (SVAEs) have previously been used for this purpose, as a carefully designed decoder can be used as an interpretable generative model of the data, while the supervised objective ensures a predictive latent representation. Unfortunately, the supervised objective forces the encoder to learn a biased approximation to the generative posterior distribution, which renders the generative parameters unreliable when used in scientific models. This issue has remained undetected as reconstruction losses commonly used to evaluate model performance do not detect bias in the encoder. We address this previously-unreported issue by developing a second-order supervision framework (SOS-VAE) that updates the decoder parameters, rather than the encoder, to induce a predictive latent representation. This ensures that the encoder maintains a reliable posterior approximation and the decoder parameters can be effectively interpreted. We extend this technique to allow the user to trade-off the bias in the generative parameters for improved predictive performance, acting as an intermediate option between SVAEs and our new SOS-VAE. We also use this methodology to address missing data issues that often arise when combining recordings from multiple scientific experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these developments using synthetic data and electrophysiological recordings with an emphasis on how our learned representations can be used to design scientific experiments.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"scientific analysis\",    \"probabilistic generative models\",    \"interpretable models\",    \"supervised learning\",    \"variational autoencoders\",    \"second-order gradient\"  ]}"}]}]}

Previous studies have investigated the effects of different selection types on trait distribution, but the effects of selection on species diversity have remained unclear. Here, we propose a framework for inferring the type and strength of selection by studying species diversity and trait distribution together against null expectations. We use a simulation model to confirm our prediction that directional selection should lead to lower species diversity than stabilizing selection despite a similar effect on trait community-weighted variance. We apply the framework to a mesocosm system of annual plants to test whether differences in species diversity between two habitats that vary in productivity are related to differences in selection on seed mass. We show that, in both habitats, species diversity was lower than the null expectation, but that species diversity was lower in the more productive habitat. We attribute this difference to strong directional selection for large-seeded species in the productive habitat as indicated by trait community-weighted-mean being higher and community-weighted variance being lower than the null expectations.

To reduce the computation cost, we introduce a parallel method that provably requires O(N) operations and delivers an approximate result within a prescribed tolerance. The distinct feature of our method is that it requires only the ability to evaluate the kernel function, offering a black-box interface to users. Our parallel approach targets multi-core shared-memory machines and is implemented using OpenMP. Numerical results demonstrate up to 19\u00d7 speedup on 32 cores. We also present a real-world application in geo-statistics, where our parallel method was used to deliver fast principle component analysis of covariance matrices.\",  \"keywords\": [    \"kernel method\",    \"matrix-vector multiplication\",    \"covariance matrix\",    \"fast multipole method\",    \"shared-memory parallelism\"  ]}"}]}]}

Others have close to equal flow values and tend to circle through jobs, search, and non-market activities. And yet others have flow values for non-market activities that are higher than those in the market, and do not work. We develop a model that identifies and quantifies heterogeneity in dynamic individual behavior. Our model provides a bridge between research on monthly transition rates in the tradition of Blanchard and Diamond (1990) and research on economic dynamics in the tradition of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Our estimates discern 5 distinct types. Most unemployment comes from just two of those types. Low employment types frequently circle among unemployment, short-term jobs, and being out of the labor market. Short-term jobs play a role in the job-finding process related to the role of unemployment. These are stop-gap jobs for high-employment types and a part of circling for low-employment types. Because of their high job-finding rates, and despite their low flow values of non-work relative to work, the volatility of the future lifetime value that high-employment types derive from work and non-work is lower than for low-employment types.\",  \"keywords\": []}"}]}]}

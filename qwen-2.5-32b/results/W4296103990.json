{"title": "Selecting For Extremists: Evaluating the Impact of Judicial Selection Methods on Ideology", "authors": [{"first": "Brett", "last": "Parker"}], "abstract": "U.S. states display striking heterogeneity in their choices of judicial selection method. Researchers have produced dozens of papers exploring how the most commonly-used selection methods\u2014partisan election, nonpartisan election, merit selection, and unconstrained gubernatorial appointment\u2014affect the ideology and behavior of the judges they produce. Nevertheless, these articles have studied only a limited set of outcome variables. Most published work concerns either how selection method affects (1) judicial responsiveness to public opinion or (2) ideological direction. To my knowledge, however, no empirical work explores how choice of selection method impacts ideological extremity. This paper fills that gap. Using generalized propensity score matching, fixed effects counterfactual estimators, and synthetic controls to conduct causal inference, I examine whether some methods of selection produce more moderate (or extreme) judges than others. In order to do so, I extend and supplement the Bonica-Woodru\ufb00 dataset on state supreme court judges, which features a commonly used measure of judicial ideology extracted from political donations. I find consistent evidence that judges picked by unconstrained gubernatorial appointment are more extreme on average than those selected by other methods. However, I do not find substantial evidence of differences between other pairs of selection methods.", "keywords": ["Judicial Selection", "State Politics", "Ideological Extremity"]}

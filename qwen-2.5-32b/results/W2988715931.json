In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regu-\nlar grids (i.e., to voxel grids or to bird\u2019s eye view images), or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point\nclouds. In this work, we return to \ufb01rst principles to con-\nstruct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as\ngeneric as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of\nthe data \u2013 samples from 2D manifolds in 3D space \u2013 we face\na major challenge when directly predicting bounding box\nparameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be\nfar from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in\none step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an\nend-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy\nof deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model\nachieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets\nof real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple\ndesign, compact model size and high ef\ufb01ciency. Remark-\nably, VoteNet outperforms previous methods by using purely\ngeometric information without relying on color images.", "keywords": []}

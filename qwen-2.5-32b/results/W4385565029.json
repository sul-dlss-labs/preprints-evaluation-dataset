{"title": "Is ChatGPT a Good Teacher Coach? Measuring Zero-Shot Performance For Scoring and Providing Actionable Insights on Classroom Instruction", "authors": [{"first": "Rose Wang", "last": "Wang"}, {"first": "Dorottya Demszky", "last": "Demszky"}], "abstract": "Coaching, which involves classroom observa-\ntion and expert feedback, is a widespread and\nfundamental part of teacher training. However,\nthe majority of teachers do not have access to\nconsistent, high quality coaching due to limited\nresources and access to expertise. We explore\nwhether generative AI could become a cost-\neffective complement to expert feedback by\nserving as an automated teacher coach. In do-\ning so, we propose three teacher coaching tasks\nfor generative AI: (A) scoring transcript seg-\nments based on classroom observation instru-\nments, (B) identifying highlights and missed\nopportunities for good instructional strategies,\nand (C) providing actionable suggestions for\neliciting more student reasoning. We recruit ex-\npert math teachers to evaluate the zero-shot per-\nformance of ChatGPT on each of these tasks for\nelementary math classroom transcripts. Our re-\nsults reveal that ChatGPT generates responses\nthat are relevant to improving instruction, but\nthey are often not novel or insightful. For ex-\nample, 82% of the model\u2019s suggestions point to\nplaces in the transcript where the teacher is al-\nready implementing that suggestion. Our work\nhighlights the challenges of producing insight-\nful, novel and truthful feedback for teachers\nwhile paving the way for future research to ad-\ndress these obstacles and improve the capacity\nof generative AI to coach teachers.", "keywords": []}

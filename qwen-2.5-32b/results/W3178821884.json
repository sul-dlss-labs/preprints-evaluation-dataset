The mid-IR unresolved emission contributes more than 60% of the nuclear (diameters of 1.5\u2032\u2032\u223c150 pc) emission in most galaxies. By contrast, the ALMA 870 \u00b5m continuum emission is mostly resolved with a median diameter of 42 pc and typically along the equatorial direction of the torus (Paper I of the series Garcia-Burillo et al. 2021). The Eddington ratios and nuclear hydrogen column densities (NH) of half the sample are favorable to launching polar and/or equatorial dusty winds, according to numerical simulations. Six of these show mid-IR extended emission approximately in the polar direction as traced by the narrow line region and perpendicular to the ALMA emission. In a few galaxies, the nuclear NH might be too high to uplift large quantities of dusty material along the polar direction. Five galaxies have low NH and/or Eddington ratios and thus polar dusty winds are not likely. We generate new radiative transfer CAT3D-WIND disk-wind models and model images at 8, 12, and 700 \u00b5m. We tailor these models to the properties of the GATOS Seyferts in this work. At low wind-to-disk cloud ratios the far-IR model images have disk- and ring-like morphologies. The characteristic \u201cX\u201d-shape associated with dusty winds is seen better in the far-IR at intermediate-high inclinations for the extended-wind configurations. In most of the explored models, the mid-IR emission comes mainly from"}

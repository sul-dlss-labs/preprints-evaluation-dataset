{"title": "The Primacy of Intention and the Duty to Truth: A Gandhi-Inspired Argument for Retranslating Hi\u1e43s\u0101 and Ahi\u1e43s\u0101, with Connections to History, Ethics, and Civil Resistance", "authors": [{"first": "Todd", "last": "Davies"}], "abstract": "The words \"violence\" and \"nonviolence\" are increasingly misleading translations for the Sanskrit words hi\u1e43s\u0101 and ahi\u1e43s\u0101 -- which were used by Gandhi as the basis for his philosophy of saty\u0101graha. I argue for re-reading hi\u1e43s\u0101 as \u201cmaleficence\u201d and ahi\u1e43s\u0101 as \u201cbeneficence.\u201d These two more mind-referring English words \u2013 associated with religiously contextualized discourse of the past -- capture the primacy of intention implied by Gandhi\u2019s core principles, better than \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201cnonviolence\u201d do. Reflecting a political turn in moral accountability detectable through linguistic data, both the scope and the usage of the word \u201cviolence\u201d have expanded dramatically. The expanded scope of \u201cviolence\u201d reflects greater consciousness of the various forms that serious harm can take, but also makes it harder to convincingly characterize people and actions as \u201cnonviolent.\u201d New translations could clarify the distinction between hi\u1e43s\u0101 and ahi\u1e43s\u0101, and thereby prevent some misunderstandings of Gandhi. Training in beneficence would reflect Gandhi\u2019s psychological path to reducing avoidable harm: detachment from the ego, learning to love universally, and seeking truth by experiment.", "keywords": ["himsa", "ahimsa", "violence", "nonviolence", "maleficence", "beneficence", "Gandhi"]}

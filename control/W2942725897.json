  "abstract": "Achievement emotions are critical because of their impact on success and failure in important\ndomains such as learning. These emotions may be modified via emotion regulation (ER). The\ndominant process model of ER (PMER; Gross, 1998, 2015), however, provides a domain-general\naccount of ER strategies and has not had substantial contact with theories of achievement\nemotions such as Pekrunâ€™s (2006) control-value theory (CVT) and the academic achievement\nliterature. Moreover, ER has not been a focal point of major theories related to achievement\nemotions, such as CVT. We propose an integrated model of ER in achievement situations\n(ERAS) that integrates propositions about the generation of emotions from CVT with\npropositions about how emotions are regulated and types of ER strategies from PMER. The\nERAS model also offers new propositions regarding how different achievement situations, object\nfoci, and time frames, as well as discrete emotions with different appraisal patterns, impact ER\nstrategies.",

  "abstract": "We introduce a special class of supersingular curves over Fp2, characterized by the existence of non-integer endomorphisms of small degree. A number of properties of this set is proved. Most notably, we show that when this set partitions into subsets in such a way that curves within each subset have small-degree isogenies between them, but curves in distinct subsets have no small-degree isogenies between them. Despite this, we show that isogenies between these curves can be computed efficiently, giving a technique for computing isogenies between certain prescribed curves that cannot be reasonably connected by searching on â„“-sogeny graphs.",

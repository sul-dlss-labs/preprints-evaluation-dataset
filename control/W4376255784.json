  "abstract": "In ethnolinguistically diverse societies, disadvantaged groups often face immense pressure to acquire and speak the language of the advantaged group to achieve social inclusion and economic mobility. This work investigates the impact on disadvantaged group members' ingroup pride and self-esteem when they use the language of the advantaged group and their native language. We test two competing hypotheses: disadvantaged group members experience higher ingroup pride when using their native language due to its emotional significance (Nativity Hypothesis) or when using the language of the advantaged group due to its potential to activate subordination-dominance relations (Insecurity Hypothesis). In six experimental studies conducted among Palestinian citizens of Israel (total N = 1,348), respondents reported significantly higher ingroup pride when answering a survey in Hebrew compared to Arabic, supporting the Insecurity Hypothesis. Studies 2a-2b reported higher ingroup pride in Hebrew, regardless of the identity of the audience (ingroup vs. outgroup researcher). Study 3 replicated this result in a setting featuring the \"bogus-pipeline\" technique, suggesting that the language effect was not driven by social desirability. Finally, Study 4 examined other self-conscious constructs to validate insecurity as a potential mechanism and demonstrated that participants engaged in compensation by enhancing their collective self-esteem and attaching more positive attributes to their group in Hebrew than Arabic. These findings combinedly suggest that the disadvantaged group members' perceptions of themselves are constructed through languages that symbolize varied statuses within the hierarchy, and highlight the importance of recognizing power relations within multilingualism contexts.",

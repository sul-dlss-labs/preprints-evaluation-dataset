  "abstract": "Background.  Emotion regulation (ER) is a key process underlying posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yet, little is known about how ER changes  with PTSD treatment. Understanding these effects may shed light on treatment processes.  Methods.  We recently completed a randomised controlled trial demonstrating that a breathing-based yoga practice (Sudarshan kriya yoga; SKY)  was not clinically inferior to cognitive processing therapy (CPT) across symptoms of PTSD, depression, or negative affect. Here, in  secondary exploratory analyses (intent-to-treat N=85; per protocol N=59), we examined whether self-reported ER (Diculties in Emotion  Regulation Scale; DERS) and physiological ER (heart rate variability; HRV) improved with treatment for clinically significant PTSD  symptoms among US Veterans.  Results.  DERS-Total and all six subscales improved with small-to-moderate effect sizes (  d = .24-.66) following CPT or SKY, with no differences  between treatment groups. Following SKY (but not CPT), HR maxâ€“min (average difference between maximum and minimum beats per  minute), normalised HF-HRV (high frequency power), and LF/HF (low-to-high frequency) ratio improved (moved towards a healthier  profile;  d = .32-.55).  Conclusions.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a breathing-based yoga (SKY) improved  both voluntary/intentional  and  automatic/physiological ER. In contrast, trauma-focused therapy (CPT) only reliably improved self-reported ER. Findings have  implications for PTSD treatment and interventions for emotional disorders more broadly.",

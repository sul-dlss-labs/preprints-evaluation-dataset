  "abstract": "Background: As allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is increasingly offered to older adults, geriatric assessments (GA) have been identified as a useful tool for predicting outcomes, particularly functional status. However, very few studies have examined the longitudinal change in GA measures in the post-alloHCT period. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to 1) describe the longitudinal change in GA and QOL measures after alloHCT and to 2) identify predictors of greater functional decline post-transplant. Study Design: In this single-center prospective cohort study, patients aged 50 years or older planning to undergo alloHCT completed a cancer-specific GA and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) survey at baseline prior to alloHCT and then at 3, 6, and 12 months after transplant. Changes in GA and QOL measures at each post-transplant time point (3, 6, or 12 months) compared to baseline were analyzed using paired t-tests. Exploration of potential predictors of greater post-transplant functional decline, as measured by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and Medical Outcomes Study Physical Health scale (MOS-PH), were examined using linear regressions and chi-squared two-sample test of proportions. Results: Mean functional status generally exhibited a pattern of decline at 3 to 6 months post-alloHCT, with recovery to near baseline by 12 months. Mean mental health and emotional QOL were lowest at baseline and improved at all time points post-transplant. Differences in baseline clinical characteristics were not associated with any differences in functional trajectories. Differences in baseline GA measures (patient-rated KPS, IADL, MOS-PH, Timed-Up-and-Go, Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test, Mental Health Inventory 5) also did not predict greater functional decline at 3 months. Patients whose IADL was improved or maintained at 3 months generally maintained their functional status at 6 and 12 months. Similarly, most patients who had IADL decline at 3 months still had functional decline at 6 months, though a portion did have functional recovery by 12 months. Compared to those with improved/maintained IADL at 3 months, those with declined IADL at 3 months were significantly more likely to have persistent functional decline at 6 months (p<0.0001) and 12 months (p=0.02). Conclusions: In older alloHCT patients, mean functional status declines short-term after alloHCT with possibility of recovery by 6 to 12 months, while mean mental and emotional health improve post-alloHCT. Functional decline at 3 months post-alloHCT is associated with persistent functional decline at 12 months.",

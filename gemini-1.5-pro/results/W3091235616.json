RTIs are a\nleading cause of death for those aged 15 â€“ 29 years with costs estimated to be up to\n3% of GDP. Despite this fact, little primary research has been done on the household\neconomic impact of these events.\n\nMethods\nFrom July to October 2016, 860 consecutive emergency department patients were\nenrolled and followed up at 6-8 weeks to assess the household financial impacts of\nthese emergency presentations. At follow-up, patients were queried regarding health\nstatus, lost wages or schooling, household costs incurred due to their injury or illness,\nand assets sold.\n\nResults\n860 patients were enrolled and 675 patients (78%) completed follow-up surveys. Of\nthose, 661 had a confirmed reason for visit - 304 (45%) road traffic injuries, 357 (53%)\nother emergency presentations (non-RTI) - encompassing medical presentations and\nother types of injury. Data was missing for 14 patients (2%). More than 90% of RTI\npatients were working or in school prior to their injury. In the economically productive\nages (15-44 years) RTI predominated (70%) vs non-RTI (39%). RTI patients were more\nlikely to report residual major disability (28% RTI vs 21% non-RTI, p<0.03). All\nemergency patients reported difficulty paying for basic needs (food, housing and\nmedical expenses). More than 1/3 of emergency patients reported having to sell assets in\norder to meet basic needs after their illness or injury. Despite similar hospital costs and\nfewer lost days of work for both patients and caregivers, the mean financial impact on\nhouseholds of RTI patients was 37% more than for non-RTI patients. These costs\nequaled between 6-16 weeks of income for patients based on their occupation type and\nmedian reported pre-hospitalization income.\n\nDiscussion\nUgandans emergency care patients suffered significant personal and household\neconomic hardship. In addition to the need for policy and infrastructural changes to\nimprove road safety, these findings highlight the need for basic emergency care\nsystems to secure economic gains in vulnerable households and prevent medical\nimpoverishment of marginal communities.", "keywords": ["Road Traffic", "Injury", "Low- and Middle-income Countries", "Economic Impact", "Emergency"]}

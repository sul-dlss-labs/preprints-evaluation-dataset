However, a naive method requires O(N2) operations, which be-\ncomes prohibitive for large-scale problems. To reduce the computation cost,\nwe introduce a parallel method that provably requires O(N) operations and\ndelivers an approximate result within a prescribed tolerance. The distinct\nfeature of our method is that it requires only the ability to evaluate the kernel\nfunction, offering a black-box interface to users. Our parallel approach tar-\ngets multi-core shared-memory machines and is implemented using OpenMP.\nNumerical results demonstrate up to 19Ã— speedup on 32 cores. We also\npresent a real-world application in geo-statistics, where our parallel method\nwas used to deliver fast principle component analysis of covariance matrices.", "keywords": ["kernel method", "matrix-vector multiplication", "covariance matrix", "fast multipole method", "shared-memory parallelism"]}

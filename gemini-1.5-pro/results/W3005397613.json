One such measure is the operator size distribution, which characterizes the size of the support region of an operator and its evolution under Heisenberg evolution. In this work, we examine the role of the operator size distribution in holographic duality for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Using an explicit construction of AdS2 bulk fermion operators in a putative dual of the low temperature SYK model, we study the operator size distribution of the boundary and bulk fermions. Our result provides a direct derivation of the relationship between (effective) operator size of both the boundary and bulk fermions and bulk SL(2; R) generators.", "keywords": []}

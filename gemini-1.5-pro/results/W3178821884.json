Torus and polar dust emission in nearby Seyfert galaxies", "abstract": "We compare high angular resolution mid-infrared (mid-IR) and ALMA far-infrared (far-IR) images of twelve nearby (median 21 Mpc) Seyfert\ngalaxies selected from the Galaxy Activity Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). The mid-IR unresolved emission contributes more than 60% of\nthe nuclear (diameters of 1.5\"~150 pc) emission in most galaxies. By contrast, the ALMA 870 µm continuum emission is mostly resolved with a\nmedian diameter of 42 pc and typically along the equatorial direction of the torus (Paper I of the series Garcia-Burillo et al. 2021). The Eddington\nratios and nuclear hydrogen column densities (NH) of half the sample are favorable to launching polar and/or equatorial dusty winds, according to\nnumerical simulations. Six of these show mid-IR extended emission approximately in the polar direction as traced by the narrow line region and\nperpendicular to the ALMA emission. In a few galaxies, the nuclear N₁ might be too high to uplift large quantities of dusty material along the\npolar direction. Five galaxies have low NH and/or Eddington ratios and thus polar dusty winds are not likely. We generate new radiative transfer\nCAT3D-WIND disk-wind models and model images at 8, 12, and 700 µm. We tailor these models to the properties of the GATOS Seyferts in this\nwork. At low wind-to-disk cloud ratios the far-IR model images have disk- and ring-like morphologies. The characteristic \"X\"-shape associated\nwith dusty winds is seen better in the far-IR at intermediate-high inclinations for the extended-wind configurations. In most of the explored\nmodels, the mid-IR emission comes mainly from the inner part of the disk/cone. Extended bi-conical and one-sided polar mid-IR emission is seen\nin extended-wind configurations and high wind-to-disk cloud ratios. When convolved to the typical angular resolution of our observations, the\nCAT3D-WIND model images reproduce qualitative aspects of the observed mid- and far-IR morphologies. However, low to intermediate values\nof the wind-to-disk ratio are required to account for the observed large fractions of unresolved mid-IR emission in our sample. This work and\nPaper I provide observational support for the torus+wind scenario. The wind component is more relevant at high Eddington ratios and/or AGN\nluminosities, and polar dust emission is predicted at nuclear column densities of up to 1024 cm-2. The torus/disk component, on the other hand,\nprevails at low luminosities and/or Eddington ratios.", "keywords": ["Galaxies: Seyfert", "Submillimeter: galaxies", "Infrared: galaxies", "Galaxies: ISM", "Galaxies: individual: NGC 1365, NGC 3227,\nNGC 4388, NGC 4941, NGC 5506, NGC 5643, NGC 6300, NGC 6814, NGC 7213, NGC 7314, NGC 7465, NGC 7582"]}

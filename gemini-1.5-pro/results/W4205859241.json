In an anonymous online survey,\nwe examined willingness to hire candidates who smoke cigarettes or are overweight for different\njob types and tested respondents' smoking history and body weight as moderating factors.\nMethods: Employed U.S. adults (N = 1107) were recruited online in 2019-2020. Respondents\nindicated their willingness to hire and hiring preferences for six different job roles in reference to\n8 different attributes, which included smoking and overweight status. Analyses tested differences\nby job-type and respondents' own smoking and overweight status. Results: Percent willing to\nhire candidates who smoke (are overweight) was 7.6% (40.3%) for health aide, 15.3% (66.2%)\nfor receptionist, and 53.6% (58.1%) for groundskeeper. Ever-smoker respondents were more\nlikely than never smokers to be willing to hire candidates who smoke (Odds Ratios [OR] = 1.98-\n3.00) and less likely to identify smoking as a least preferred attribute (ps < .009). Overweight\nrespondents were more likely than non-overweight respondents to be willing to hire overweight\ncandidates (OR = 1.47-1.99) and less likely to identify overweight as a least preferred attribute\n(ps < .002). Moderating effects of respondent smoking or overweight status were greater for the\npublic-facing receptionist versus groundskeeper position. Conclusions: In hypothetical hiring\ndecisions, smoking and overweight were viewed as undesirable, particularly among respondents\nwithout the attribute tested.", "keywords": ["smoking", "overweight", "bias", "employment", "judgment"]}

{"authors": [{"first": "Brett", "last": "Parker"}], "title": "Selecting For Extremists: Evaluating the Impact of Judicial Selection Methods on Ideology", "abstract": "U.S. states display striking heterogeneity in their choices of judicial selection method.\nResearchers have produced dozens of papers exploring how the most commonly-used\nselection methods-partisan election, nonpartisan election, merit selection, and uncon-\nstrained gubernatorial appointment-affect the ideology and behavior of the judges\nthey produce. Nevertheless, these articles have studied only a limited set of outcome\nvariables. Most published work concerns either how selection method affects (1) judicial\nresponsiveness to public opinion or (2) ideological direction. To my knowledge, however,\nno empirical work explores how choice of selection method impacts ideological extremity.\nThis paper fills that gap. Using generalized propensity score matching, fixed effects\ncounterfactual estimators, and synthetic controls to conduct causal inference, I examine\nwhether some methods of selection produce more moderate (or extreme) judges than\nothers. In order to do so, I extend and supplement the Bonica-Woodruff dataset on state\nsupreme court judges, which features a commonly used measure of judicial ideology\nextracted from political donations. I find consistent evidence that judges picked by\nunconstrained gubernatorial appointment are more extreme on average than those\nselected by other methods. However, I do not find substantial evidence of differences\nbetween other pairs of selection methods.", "keywords": ["Judicial Selection", "State Politics", "Ideological Extremity"]}

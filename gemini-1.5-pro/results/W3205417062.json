Selection is classified as\nstabilizing when species with intermediate trait values gain the highest reproductive success,\nwhereas selection is considered directional when fitness is highest for species with extreme trait\nvalues. Previous studies have investigated the effects of different selection types on trait\ndistribution, but the effects of selection on species diversity have remained unclear. Here, we\npropose a framework for inferring the type and strength of selection by studying species diversity\nand trait distribution together against null expectations. We use a simulation model to confirm\nour prediction that directional selection should lead to lower species diversity than stabilizing\nselection despite a similar effect on trait community-weighted variance. We apply the framework\nto a mesocosm system of annual plants to test whether differences in species diversity between\ntwo habitats that vary in productivity are related to differences in selection on seed mass. We\nshow that, in both habitats, species diversity was lower than the null expectation, but that species\ndiversity was lower in the more productive habitat. We attribute this difference to strong\ndirectional selection for large-seeded species in the productive habitat as indicated by trait\ncommunity-weighted-mean being higher and community-weighted variance being lower than the\nnull expectations. In the less productive habitat, we found that community-weighted variance\nwas higher than expected by chance, suggesting that seed mass could be a driver of niche\npartitioning under such conditions. Altogether, our results suggest that viewing species diversity\nand trait distribution as interrelated patterns driven by the same process, ecological selection, is\nhelpful in understanding community assembly.", "keywords": ["annual plants", "community weighted mean", "community weighted variance", "competition", "environmental filtering", "functional diversity", "functional traits", "seed mass", "seed\nsize", "species richness", "species pool", "trait selection"]}

We focus on the setting where units, e.g., individuals, \ufb01rms, or states, adopt the policy or treatment of interest at a particular point in time, and then remain exposed to this treatment at all times afterwards. We take a design perspective where we investigate the properties of estimators and procedures given assumptions on the assignment process. We show that under random assignment of the adoption date the standard Di\ufb00erence-In-Di\ufb00erences estimator is is an unbiased estimator of a particular weighted average causal e\ufb00ect. We characterize the properties of this estimand, and show that the standard variance estimator is conservative.", "keywords": ["Staggered Adoption Design", "Di\ufb00erence-In-Di\ufb00erences", "Fixed E\ufb00ects", "Randomization Distribution"]}

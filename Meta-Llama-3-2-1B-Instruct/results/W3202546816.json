Recent advances in using data-driven approaches have achieved significant improvements in terms of prediction accuracy. However, the lack of group-aware analysis has limited the performance of forecasting models. This is especially nonnegligible in highly crowded scenes, where pedestrians are moving in groups and the interactions between groups are extremely complex and dynamic. In this paper, we present Grouptron, a multi-scale dynamic forecasting framework that leverages pedestrian group detection and utilizes individual-level, group-level, and scene-level information for better understanding and representation of the scenes. Our approach employs spatio-temporal clustering algorithms to identify pedestrian groups, creates spatio-temporal graphs at the individual, group, and scene levels, and then uses graph neural networks to encode dynamics at different scales and aggregate the embeddings for trajectory prediction. We conducted extensive comparisons and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 9.3% decrease in final displacement error (FDE) compared with state-of-the-art methods on ETH/UCY benchmark datasets, and 16.1% decrease in FDE in more crowded scenes where extensive human group interactions are more frequently present.", "keywords": ["group-aware", "dense crowd", "trajectory forecasting", "spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks", "graph neural networks", "pedestrian group detection", "pedestrian trajectory forecasting", "dynamic forecasting", "multi-scale", "deep learning"]}

{"title": "The Stationary Prophet Inequality Problem", "authors": ["Kristen Kessel", "Amin Saberi", "Ali Shameli", "David Wajc"], "abstract": "We study a continuous and in\\infty time horizon counterpart to the classic prophet inequality, which we term the stationary prophet inequality problem. Here, copies of a good arrive and perish according to Poisson point processes. Buyers arrive similarly and make take-it-or-leave-it offers for unsold items. The objective is to maximize the (infty time average revenue of the seller.", "keywords": ["prophet inequality", "stationary prophet inequality problem", "continuous-time", "infinite-time horizon", "Poisson point process", "Poisson arrivals", "PASTA", "queueing theory", "online algorithms", "mechanism design"]}

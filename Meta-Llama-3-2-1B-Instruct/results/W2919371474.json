{"title": "Job-Finding and Job-Losing: A Comprehensive Model of Heterogeneous Individual Labor-Market Dynamics", "authors": [{"first": "Robert E.", "last": "Hall"}, {"first": "Marianna", "last": "Kudlyak"}], "abstract": "We study the economics of personal labor-market dynamics. Some working-age people face \ufb02ow values from a job that considerably exceed the \ufb02ow value of any available non-market activity. If they lose a job, they tend to \ufb01nd another fairly soon through intensive search. Other people have close to equal \ufb02ow values and tend to circle through jobs, unemployment, and non-market activities. And some people have generally higher values in non-market activities and take jobs infrequently or not at all.", "keywords": ["job-finding", "job-losing", "labor-market-dynamics", "heterogeneous-individual-labor-market-dynamics", "unemployment", "job-search", "search-process"]}

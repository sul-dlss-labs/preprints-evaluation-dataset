This paper presents evidence on an additional unexplored mechanism: campaigns, that can act before voters, adjust their behavior when allocated a top position on the ballot. We use a constituency-level lottery of ballot positions in Colombia to establish first that a ballot-order e\ufb00ect exists: campaigns randomly placed at the top earn more votes and seat shares. Second, we show that campaigns react to being placed on top of the ballot: they raise and spend more money on their campaign, and spending itself is correlated with higher vote shares. Our results provide the first evidence for a new mechanism of ballot-order e\ufb00ects examined in many previous studies.", "keywords": ["ballot-order e\ufb00ects", "campaigns", "behavioral", "electoral-performance", "party-lists", "salient-informa-tion", "strategic-behavior"]}
